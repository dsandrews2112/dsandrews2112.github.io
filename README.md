# About Me

## My Interests

I have a wide range of interests that shape my hobbies and passions. Some of my key interests include:

- **Audio:** I love the technology, analyzation, live experience, and production of audio. It is my true passion.
- **Technology:** I think the advancement of technology reflects the social status of the world
- **Travel:** Traveling is something I wish I could do more. Experiencing new things is far more valuable than material, and I live by that.
- **Guitar:** I love the idea of being able to critically enjoy audio while also being able to produce high quality audio for others. 

## Websites I Recommend

1. [Library of Babel](https://libraryofbabel.info)
   - This website has generated every single piece of text ever conceived. If you search for any string of characters, somewhere within the library it exists. 

2. [Head-Fi](https://www.head-fi.org)
   - The largest database of audiophile forums, as well as a used marketplace for audio products. Some of the most constructive conversations I've ever seen occur on this website.

3. [270 To Win](https://www.270towin.com)
   - One of the most unbiased sources of political news. Simply displays maps and provides peer reviewed fact checks of claims made by politicians.
